# Electromagnetic valve
This program (done in ST language) simulates control mechanisms of an electromagnetic valve that can either let water go through or not.
The valve has 2 modes:
 - Automatic, where it's position is adjusted automatically depending on the water level gauge.
 - Manual, where the operator can adjust it's work on demand.

The program has a simple user interface to get the necessary information or control valve quickly.

Here's how it looks:
